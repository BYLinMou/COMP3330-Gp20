# Project Overview

Our goal is to build a Money Managing system that provides users with a comprehensive platform for personal finance management. The system is designed with the following key features:

- **Multi-currency Management:** Users can manage their finances in multiple currencies, making it suitable for international and local users alike.
- **Analyst Functionality:** The platform allows users to analyze their financial data, providing insights and trends to help with better financial planning.
- **AI-powered Data Entry:** Users can upload data (such as photos of receipt), and the system leverages AI to automatically fill in transaction records, reducing time cost of manual input.
- **Saving Goals & Budget Management:** Users can set up saving goals and budgets, helping them track progress and manage their spending effectively.
- **Future Plans:** If feasible, we aim to implement a chatbot, enabling users to interact with the system and receive financial planning advice from AI in a conversational manner.
